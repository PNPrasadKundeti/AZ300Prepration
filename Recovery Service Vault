Recovery Service Vault
   
Azure Backups is a managed backup service provided by Microsoft. It includes a range of tools to support backing up both Windows and Linux data from on-premises storage systems, other cloud environments, and Azure itself.
Whichever Azure Backup tool we use, the first step is always going to be the creation of a recovery services vault.
When configuring the software, we will also need to use the vault credentials, so that the software has access to store data in the recovery services vault.
Steps to Configure Azure Backups:
Configure a Recovery Services Vault
Install the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent
Register the agent with our vault using the credentials
Perform a backup
Perform the recovery of data
Please note that when you use Azure Backups you MUST keep a copy of your passphrase, as Microsoft cannot restore this for you.
It is recommended you store this within your organization's enterprise password management tool.
It is possible to use Azure Key Vault to store this, though that is not it's direct purpose.
